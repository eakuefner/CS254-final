\section{Future directions}

\note{Important questions to be answered - What does is mean to design instruction caches for functional programs? What does it mean to design caches for non-linear data structures like objects in dynamic languages? What are the hardware/architectural modifications required to support better branch prediction strategies for dynamic scripting language interpreters? What about specialized hardware to speedup JIT optimizations and program analysis? If most of the objects created in a dynamic scripting language are short lived, do we really need to cache each object as soon as it is created? Can the compiler/program analyzer give hints to the branch predictor for better prediction and hint memory management system not to cache certain objects?}
