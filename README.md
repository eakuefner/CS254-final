Examining the Connection Between Hardware Architecture and Virtual Machine Design
===========

A survey by Ethan A. Kuefner and Madhukar N. Kedlaya for CS254: Advanced Computer Architecture, UC Santa Barbara

In this paper we study techniques for optimizing virtual machine runtimes based on exploiting properties of the
underlying hardware architectures. As well, we propose a number of ideas for future work based on these
techniques.
